Time series analysis and forecasting for stock market

Python’s pandas library is a powerful, comprehensive library with a wide variety of inbuilt functions for analyzing time series data. In this article, we saw how pandas can be used for wrangling and visualizing time series data.

We also performed tasks like time sampling, time shifting and rolling with stock data. These are usually the first steps in analyzing any time series data. Going forward, we could use this data to perform a basic financial analysis by calculating the daily percentage change in stocks to get an idea about the volatility of stock prices. Another way we could use this data would be to predict Adani's stock prices for the next few days by employing machine learning techniques. This would be especially helpful from the shareholder’s point of view.
